# Captain Badass - game that killed the company

Captain Badass is a mobile game that started as a fun two week detour from the main title we were working on and ended up taking almost a year to release and effectively killed our gaming company OSM Games. Well, at least now there is this nice trailer.

The big idea was to use stop motion animation for all graphic elements in the game. Player planes, enemies and even bullets are actual physical objects that were photographed frame by frame and then put together into animated sequences. We probably made every possible mistake while working on this game therefore we learned enormous amount, but ultimately had to pay the hefty price.

## The Idea

We had a small game development studio and we were working on our main title Puke'n'Roll. The whole company started from the idea for that game but it was a bit above our competences at the time. The development went slowly, especially the coding part. Everybody was a bit tired from not releasing anything and we had some spare illustrator / animator capacity in the team. So our illustrator Andrius Labašauskas came up with an idea to make a simple game where all objects were captured using stop motion animation. We liked the idea and green-lighted it. We caped the timeline to around two weeks and agreed that we will be working on weekends on this fun side project. We chose fruits and vegetables as the main theme, because they were colorful, diverse and easy to get. We decided that the game will be a vertical shooter.

First few weekends were lots of fun! We got all sorts of equipment including green screens, lights and good cameras from our friends working in film industry. We bought few big bags of exotic fruits and vegetables and I bought the box of plane models that I loved building when I was a kid. We started photographing them and trying out different animations. The photo below illustrated well how our studio looked like at the moment.

## Development Hell

After the first two weeks the remaining fruits and vegetables started to rot and so did our timeline and the whole project in general. We were nowhere near the completion and coding part was especially lagging. These were the days where the robust frameworks like Unity with it's asset store where you could buy the template for a vertical shooter and do the asset swap with some modifications were still in their infancy and still using licensing model that was way too expensive for us. So we were working with open-source framework called Cocos2D and we had to implement most of the game logic and most of the systems from scratch.

Weeks went by and we were not advancing with the project much. What was even worse that the project started taking lots of developer time from our main project sinking it even further. We also started taking in external app development work to support the company, something that we were proudly refusing to this point reasoning that we are the game development studio. Our main client became one of the biggest TV stations in Lithuania and they had strict timelines and high expectations. We ended up juggling developers between projects with work for clients always winning the priority battles. This situation ended up dragging for almost a year and constantly sinking the company further and further. But at least after almost a year of struggle our two week fun project was ready to hit the market.


## Release disaster

Happy with our production ready build we started working on final "formalities" such as uploading the game to Apple AppStore and planning marketing efforts. What we have not taken into account was that during that year the market changed drastically, there was a flood of new games being released every day, premium model didn't work at all anymore, niche for simple single player artsy looking games was practically non existent, especially if you didn't have huge marketing budgets.


## Fighting Apple over profanity

What we also didn't anticipate was that Apple is going to be such a pain in the ass. After fixing all minor technical details after their initial review, they informed us that the game cannot be published because it violates their non-profanity clause. Apparently the title "Captain Badass" was considered to be too offensive and profane. Of course we started doing what any reasonable but inexperienced developer would do: argue with Apple trying to prove that they are wrong, pointing out the fact that there were numerous apps and games in their store where word "badass" or even "ass" was used as well as other arguments. Of course all we achieved was losing another month. We had to change the name.

We had quite a few names for the game until we finally arrived at Captain Badass. The first working title was Veggie Shooter, that's how XCode projects were named. We also for whatever reason were thinking about monosodium glutamate inspired name E621, the E number for most popular flavour enhancer. I honestly don't remember logic behind all this, something related to vegetables being healthy and E621 not, either way, pretty tragic idea for naming a video game. Another marvel of creativity was the name "Fruits Not Birds" which was basically a mashup of the names of two very popular mobile games at the time called "Fruit Ninja" and "Angry Birds". The logic behind it was to get some exposure when people are searching to one of these popular games. When I told this to one friend who was working with marketing, he replied: "Really? This is your marketing strategy?".

Given all this struggle with finding the name and the fact that all assets, title screens, icon, etc. were prepared under the name and theme of Captain Badass, we decided to just make the name in the AppStore and descriptions "Captain Bad...", but leave "Captain Badass" inside the game. This strategy worked and we passed Apple censorship, but of course our ability to market a game that was called differently in the app store was laughable and marketing under the name "Captain Bad..." with these three stupid dots and two generic words was equally miserable.


## Final flop

Adding to complexity of our robust marketing plan was the fact that our marketing budget for this game was zero. The company wasn't doing too well and mobile game market was already at the point when if you can't spend at least few hundred thousand into marketing, you are just throwing the money away. We did try to find the publisher for the game earlier, but we didn't get any traction. The recurring theme is their response was: "Why the hell world needs another vertical shooter?". And our explanations about the artistic value and unique stop-motion animation didn't convince them. Rightfully so, I must admit, as there were probably thousand vertical shooters at the time that were better than Captain Badass in the market before. But when you are working on something for almost a year, you usually develop false sense of value.

Given the marketing budget all marketing efforts were done by us. We tried to reach media outlets, game review sites and anybody who might be interested. We got some coverage in local mainstream media, just because we had some connections there, but from cold sending e-mails to around 150 video game related outlets, we got two or three reviews. One of the reviews I remember very well, it basically said: "The game is garbage, but the soundtrack is banging! It looks like the game was just quickly throws together as a marketing prop for the soundtrack release.". Flattered as I was as I was the creator of the soundtrack, it was clear: our game sucks big time! And sales numbers confirmed that. In first two weeks after the release we have sold... 3 copies.

One more funny fact is that we decided to release this game as a premium game, meaning that you need to buy it in order to play it. Premium model was already dead on mobile at the time, and especially for simple game like this was nonsensical to expect anybody to pay while all the alternatives around are free to download. I guess we were still driven by the fact that just a year or so ago people were paying money for games like Paper Toss where you just throw piece of paper into trash can with the swipe motion or even our own game Kartuvės, which has pretty good sales for the time when it was released while also being premium. We made few first levels free and added full game as an in-app purchase, but we just spend few more days of developer time for nothing: any release momentum however insignificant was already gone and just a few random people downloaded it and that was the end of it.


## Warblade

The original inspiration for Captain Badass was Warblade: the best vertical shooter ever! It is a modern remake of classic game Deluxe Galaga that was released for Amiga computers in 1993. Which is "loosely based" on 1981 arcade classic Galaga by Namco. Which is a sequel to Galaxian released two years before. Which is a rip off of Space Invaders, a japanese arcade classic from 1978 designed by Tomohiro Nishikado.

The mastermind behind Warblade as well as original Deluxe Galaga is Edgar Vigdal, a Norwegian game development legend who started making games for Sinclair, Commodore and Amiga systems, and continued releasing games PC, Mac and iOS. Unfortunately Edgar died in 2015 after loosing a battle to cancer, mid-way in finishing the sequel to Warblade called Warblade MK II.

Warblade is an amazing example of game design: addictive, satisfying, intense and always challenging. It has interesting weapons, good leveling up system. And when you finish all 100 levels you start over from level 1 but enemies are a bit faster and more powerful. So it creates this dynamic where after really hard final battles in end levels, you are thrown back into first level and things feel so easy and you feel overpowered. You feel like god for few levels and then things become challenging again. And you can go forever like this. Actually Warblade is so addictive that I have to admit I once missed university exam because I was playing it till 6 in the morning.

This is v0.1 of this article. Coming soon: monosodium glutamate inspired name of the game, fighting Apple over profanity, lots of media and animated images from the game and ground shaking soundtrack that ended up being way more impressive than the game itself.
