Travel in the hyper-stylized realms made out of silhouettes. Follow your intuition to unveil what’s hidden from the naked eye. In this new mind-bending action puzzler - your perspective is your main weapon.

This game will make you smart. Not Oxford-smart, more like microdosing-in-Silicon Valley-smart. Twisted logics will blend your mind, so be aware that you may never see things the same after playing one of the most bizarre games of the year.
