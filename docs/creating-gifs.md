# Creating GIFs for projects

- Start with 960x540 video
- Use [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/) to create GIFs
- Select '480xAUTO' for the size, 7 for FPS, and FFMPEG for the method and convert to GIF
- Select optimize and choose 'Lossy GIF' with compression level 150
- Export the frame from the 960x540 video and use it as the thumbnail (with iMovie: select frame, click share and export single frame)
