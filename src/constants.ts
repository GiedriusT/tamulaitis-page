export const WHO_I_AM = 'I\'m Giedrius, a resident of Amsterdam originally hailing from Vilnius. Fascinated by technology and arts, exploring the sweet spot where the two collide. Here I share the stories about my projects.';
export const WHAT_I_DO = 'My fascination with technology and arts started when my father bought me my first computer back in 1995. Since then I am on a constant journey of learning, building and creating. I love both technology and arts and am most fascinated to work on projects where the two go hand in hand. Currently mostly focused on a professional career as a technology leader and raising an amazing daughter, I still try to find the time to work on something creative and fun. I love to meet like minded individuals, so if you found some of my projects interesting, have something to suggest or want to collaborate, don\'t hesitate to drop me a line!';
