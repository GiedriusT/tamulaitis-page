# Kamchatka vinyl

This vinyl record is a re-release of my first EP titled "Kamchatka". It was originally released in 2010 as a limited edition of 50 CDs as well as digital format. To mark its ten year anniversry I decided to re-release it on vinyl. All tracks were re-mastered by Emery in his Rotterdam studio and vinyls pressed in the Netherlands by [Triple Vision Distribution](https://triplevisiondigital.com/).

Nuotraukos

The artwork for this release was created by an amazing artist [Asta Ostrovskaja](https://astaost.com/). It actually depicts the SaulÄ—tekis neighborhood where I grew up in Vilnius, Lithuania.


## What's next?

I  want this vinyl to be available in as many physical recordshops as possible. I find digging for records in a recordshop a very unique experience and want to make it  possible for others to accidentally stumble upon my music.


## Where to buy?

The vinyl is available in recordshops across Lithuania and the Netherlands, you can also order it online from [Bembis Bembio Motina Records](https://bembisbembiomotina.lt) website.


## Original version

Original version of the album was released in 2010 as a limited edition of 50 CDs as well as digital format.

## Bonus material

This release also includes one bonus track that was not included in the original release. It is called "Celebration" and was made by me recording and scratching the samples from the old vinyl records and mixing them together. It was originally used for the promotional video of the initial release.

The video used for this clip is from the Internet Archive and is in the public domain. As I was correctly schooled in the comments the people depicted in the video are not actually from Kamchatka region, they  are more likely to be native Alaskan (Inupiat) or natives of Chukotka (Chukchi, Siberian Yupik), based on the cloathing and dancing styles.
