# Dialrhea - revolutionary shitty machine

This device is a modified rotary phone that has been repurposed to control the classic first-person shooter game Doom via Bluetooth. We built it in two days during the "Internet Of Shit" hackathon organised by Technarium crew in Vilnius, Lithuania. The theme of this hackathon was to build devices that are completely useless, but fully functional. Here is Dialrhea in action at Vilnius TechPark:

Of course the device of such nonsensity wouldn't be complete without a "slick" promotional video showing how life without the device is just impossible. Here you can see video we used for the presentation.
