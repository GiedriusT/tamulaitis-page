# Dialrhea - revolutionary shitty machine

This device is a modified rotary phone that has been repurposed to control the classic first-person shooter game Doom via Bluetooth. The phone's rotary dial is used to control the game's actions such as movement and firing weapons. The device connects to a computer running the game via Bluetooth, and is built on Arduino microcontroller.

We also made a proper "slick" promotional video for the device:

This device was built in two days during Internet Of Shit hackathon organised by Technarium crew in Vilnius, Lithuania. The purpose of this hackathon is to build devices that are completely useless from practical poinnt of view, but must be functional and actually work, and you only have two days to do it.

## The Story

The device is made using an Arduino microcontroller, which is a popular platform for DIY projects and maker projects. The Arduino is used to read the inputs from the rotary dial and buttons on the phone and translate them into commands that can be sent to the computer running the game via Bluetooth. The device was created during a hackathon called "Internet of Shit", which is a playful name for a hackathon that focuses on repurposing and repurposing old or discarded technology in creative ways.

During the hackathon, the device was built and tested by a team of makers, programmers and gamers, who were able to get the device working and connect it to the game. The device was then tested out by famous Lithuanian entrepreneurs like Vladas La≈°as, who were impressed by the unique concept and the level of creativity involved in the project. They were also able to experience the nostalgia of using an old rotary phone to control a classic game and found it to be an enjoyable and fun experience.

Overall, the device is a great example of how old technology can be repurposed in creative ways to create something new and unique. The device is a great reminder that with a little bit of creativity and a lot of hard work, anything is possible.
