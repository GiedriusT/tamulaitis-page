# Walker: My first game

Around 199? I wrote my first game. I gave it a name "Walker". I might say the name was inspired by "Walker, Texas Ranger" that was new on TV at the time and was the first badass action TV series on the post-soviet TV stations we had available in Lithuania at the time.

Another possible source of the name "Walker" is the fact that pretty much the only thing you can do in this game is walk. Well, you can also shoot at the enemy, but if you do, then you cannot walk or do anything else until the bullet hits something. This not extremely engaging experience stemmed from the fact that I didn't knew how to create non blocking loops in Pascal programming language. It was 386 and DOS era, and making anything apprear to be happening in parallel was quite a challenge.

Nevertheless, the game had an animated title screen with music and fully functioning menu system, I probably spent around 90% of the whole development time on these two components.

The game was written in Borland Pascal.
