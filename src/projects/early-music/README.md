# Early Music / FastTracker era

From early days I was attending music school "Ąžuoliukas" where I was taught music theory and forced to learn to play and sing classical songs. When teenage years started kicking in it became less and less interesting to spend time on these activities.

Around the same time first casettes with electronic music became available at [illegal casette markets](#illegal-casette-markets). That's when I was introduced to electronic music. At that time it was mostly bands like 2 Unlimited, Culture Beat, Scooter that people my age ended up listening to. Some sort of party eurotrance or eurodance as it was mostly called back in those days.

Next step was what we called "rave" which was some sort of happy hardcore vibe songs, mostly remixes and remakes of classic songs with sped up vocals packed into bootlegs. I remeber one series called "Disco Nevada", there were tons of volumes of this series, it was very popular at the time. You couldn't listen to what you are buying before you bought it, so a lot of that was just luck and just trying out some names you hear your classmates talk about having no idea if you will actually like it or not. That's how I ended up buying more serious stuff like Marusha, Mark 'Oh and eventually "Music for the Jilted Generation" by The Prodigy.

I was amazed by these sounds, but it only seemed to be possible to do something like this with very expensive equipment and very special knowledge. That was until one evening my neibghour Tadas brought few [floppy discs](#floppy-disc) with ScreamTracker. [Trackers](#trackers) were first type of music making software working on DOS operating systems and able to play few tracks of samples simultaneously.
