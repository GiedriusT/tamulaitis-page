## Remixes

There were also quite a few nice remixes made for this track by Lynx, Leon Somov, Genys, ENiGMA Dubz and Kial. It is always very interesting to hear your music being reinterpreted and spun off in so many different tangents.

One of the remixes for the track made by famous Lithuanian producer Leonas Somov was also released on the compilation called "Chilling on the Couch 04" by the Netherlands based [Scientific Records](https://www.scientific.nl/). It's a nice series of relaxed and mellow music that is specifically tailored for just chilling on the couch. Our track found it's place there alongside other underground artists like Nuage, Mav, Andre Sobota and others.

## Vinyl

One very different remix came from Lynx, a legendary UK drum'n'bass producer best known for his Lynx & Kemo collaboration and countless bangers released on legendary labels like Hospitality Records and Samurai Records. This fast and chaotic piece even found it's place on wax. It was released in 2015 by Ambra Recordings as a beautiful marbled vinyl alongside Random Movement remix of the Love Forever track by Simplification. This was the first time my name appeared on a vinyl record.

## Filming the video

One of the most interesting aspects about this project was filming the video. For me it was the first time I was so closely involved in the process of shooting music video. We went to scout for locations, discussed technical aspects of shooting, helped with moving the lights and holding props.

The video was directed by Danielius Bučkus and filmed by Jara Gavrin, two prominent figures in Lithuanian cinema scene. We were lucky that they really liked the track and offered to shoot that video as a hobby project. They had previously made another video for Emery & Umiko for a track they made together with Semi Sense and MC Fats called "Starchaser". You can check it out here: [Emery & Semi Sense feat. MC Fats & Umiko - Starchaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV6b8hZ4IYc).

There were three main location where we did the shootings. First one was legendary music and culture venue called Loftas. It is run by Viktoras Diawara, a famous musician and the force behind tons of musical and cultural projects. Loftas had left it's footprint in Lithuanian culture with performances by tons of local and foreign artists and even their own three day music festival in the middle of the city. It is a huge industrial space with a lot of interesting details and textures. It was a perfect place for shooting the closeup scenes with Umiko and experimenting with ultraviolet light and makeup.

Another impressive location was Europos Parkas (Park of Europe) an open air museum located in the center of Europe. Or so they claim. Apparently it's really hard to determine the exact center of any oddly shaped object and Europe is exactly that, that's why most european nations have their own center of Europe. Despite the ambiguity of the center of Europe title the park is truly amazing, full of sculptures and impressive art installations from artists all around the world. It was a perfect place to hunt for weird angles and perspectives.

The last location was a small forest with the beautiful lake near Vilnius. Surroundings are beautiful, but even more impressive is the white mud that covers one side of the lake. It's an uncommon sight in Lithuania and worked really well with our black and white aesthetics. We were lucky to have a sunny day and the light was just perfect for the shots. It was a bit cold thou, so it was quite a challenge for Umiko to stay in the water for a long time.

## The controversy

We were really happy with the final result and decided to submit the video for various competitions. One of the competitions was the music video track of the "Kino Pavasaris", the biggest international film festival in Lithuania. To our surprise it was rejected in the first round and the reasoning was that our video: "promotes and glorifies slavery". That was equally annoying and hilarious, as it was hard to wrap our heads around how anybody could interpret our mellow and innocent video this way. After some digging we found that it was just one person from the jury that got deeply offended by the video and made a big issue out of it. That is a good example how differently people interpret things and that if you are a creator then whatever you do there will always be someone who will be offended by your work. In the end art is all about triggering the emotional response in people, so we definitely nailed it in that regard.
