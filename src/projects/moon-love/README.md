# Moon Love

Moon love is a track and music video that we made with studio collegue Emery and amazingly talented artist Umiko.



## Remixes

There was also quite a few of nice remixes made for this track by Leon Somov, Genys, ENiGMA Dubz and Kial. It is always very interesting to hear your music being reinterpreted and spun off in so many different tangents.

One of the remixes for the track made by famous Lithuanian producer Leonas Somov was also  released on the compilation called Chilling on the Sofa alongsite the artists like … The compilation was released good X years after the remix was made, but it was still very exciting to see the sounds living on. Chilling on a Sofa is a nice series of compilations of chilled out music that as name implies is most suitable for listening when sitting on the couch. You can find them all on Spotify.


## Vinyl

My studio collegue Emery had a record label Ambra Recordings where he was releasing mostly drum’n’bass tracks, more melodic sort. It was a pleasant surprise when he decided to put one of the remixes of Moon Love on vinyl as part of a compilation. That was the first time my name appeared on a vinyl record, so it was a significant event for me.

If you are into liquid drum’n’bass you should check out more music from Ambra Recordings, here is a link to their Spotify playlist.


## Filming the video

One of the most interesting aspects about this project was filming the video. For me it was the first time I was so closely involved in the process of shooting music video. We went to scout for locations, discussed technical aspects of shooting 

The video was directed by Danielius Bučkus and filmed by Jara Gavrin, two prominent figures in Lithuanian cinema scene. We were lucky that they really liked the track and offered to shoot that video as a hobby project. So we were able to use nice new cameras, railings and all other sorts of cinema gear.
