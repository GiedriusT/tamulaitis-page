# Bembis Bembio Motina - über eclectic record label

Bembis Bembio Motina Records is an uber eclectic record label that I started back in a day. It started as a joke and the literal translation of the name is Bamby Bamby's mother if you must know. I also made the funny logo with two headed Bamby blasting the sounds from his ears.

The label has eight releases under it's belt including my own music, mixes by famous Lithuanian Dj's and even an illustrated musical fairytale about a toad, a cow and the meaning of life.

## History

Back in a day we had a hip-hop crew called Fresh Rice Crew that consisted of around seven members. We were engaged in lots of activities like recording music, writing articles about artists and Djs, organizing events and rehearsing for shows. But we spent most of the time arguing what we should do and how exactly should we do it. Sometimes we would gather to rehearse, but wouldn't even touch the equipment, because all the time was spent discussing and contemplating about the future.

It was one of these rehearsals during which the name and the idea for Bembis Bembio Motina was born. We were rehearsing in a flat of Matas Labašauskas, one of the MCs of Fresh Rice Crew and now a prominent figure in Lithuania's culture scene, running his own music venues and organizing music festivals for very niche and unique music (check out [Braille Satellite festival](https://www.braille-satellite.pro/) here). We were all tired of our discussions and were already fooling around and somehow somebody just spit out the phrase "Bembis Bembio Motina Records", which was immediately followed by ten minute long laughing session.

Coming up with these nonsensical creative ideas wasn't anything out of the ordinary for us and this was one of the thousand that were meant to be forgotten half an hour after they were born. But for some reason it got stuck in my head and after coming home that evening I opened Photoshop and made a funny logo for this imaginary record label, just for a fun of it. However after showing it to some friends everybody said it was hilarious and that I should actually start a record label.


## First release

First release of Bembis Bembio Motina was as serious as the label itself: not serious at all. We made a few recordings with my good friend Def One who was the best beat-boxer in the Baltic states at the time. They mostly consisted of him beat-boxing around the phrase "Striuki Kriuki" which we used extensively to annoy the shop attendant at all night liquor store we were frequent visitors of at the time. It was released in a form of CD with color covers and everything. Of course it's worth mentioning that it was a very limited run of just 3 CDs. One we gifted to the shop attendant we used to annoy, other two are owned by me and Def One.


## Mixtapes by Dj Quazar & 2 Fresh

Funny as it was the first release bought Bembis Bembio Motina name into the scope of quite a few of my musician friends. Many of them were starting out as Djs and were recording their mixtapes from vinyl records. To my surprise they started asking if their mixes are something that Bembis Bembio Motina would like to release.

This is how the first proper releases of Bembis Bembio Motina came to life. The first was a blend of funk, soul and hip-hop grooves served by Tadas Quazar who went on to become a well known name in Lithuania's night life scene shaping the musical taste of the whole generation of clubbers and festival goers. It was titled "Močiutės Popkornai" that has a dubious meaning in Lithuanian language and can be translated to either "grandmother's popcorns" or "grandmothers who themselves are popcorns". You can **[listen to Močiutės Popkornai by Quazar on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmdl4pIapWY)**.

Second was a collaboration between the same Tadas Quazar and 2Fresh, member of the legendary Boogaloo crew who started making underground parties back in 1994 playing acid jazz, funk, soul and rap music, western sounds that you couldn't hear anywhere else in Lithuania that had just regained it's independence from soviet union. The mix was titled "In > True > Mentals" and blended instrumentals from more alternative hip-hop artists like RJD2, Camp Lo and Danny Breaks with acapellas from hip-hop grands like Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and Lords Of The Underground.


## My music

After first few releases I already had recording studio and was focusing on producing and releasing my own music under the name Garo. That turned out to be disastrous stage name for a musician as apparently that is a common name given to people in Armenia as well as name of very popular TV series in Japan. In addition there is also a fish called Garo as well as Japaneese band with the same name. Actually there is even a tribe in India named Garo and they have their own language called Garo language, and there was an ancient Kingdom of Garo somewhere in south Ethiopia. You can find [full list of Garos in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garo). Given all that, if you search for Garo in Google my music will be the last thing you will find.

Kamchatka EP was my first solo release and featured 5 tracks mostly made by sampling old vinyl records and fusing them together with synth sounds and live recordings of different instruments. Highlight was the track called "Freddy" which was inspired by "Nightmare on the Elm Street" movies featuring Freddy Krueger as a villain. Dark and bass-heavy it was a favorite of many of my listeners. You can **[listen to Garo - Kamchatka EP on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3MFM6vUUTnfpY3vG2Wu7vI)**.

A year later came three track EP called "Sewers" that was focused around the theme song from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a cartoon that I was obsessed with while growing up. Twisting the main theme into the directions of broken hip-hop and intelligent dubstep all three tracks offered a unique take on this iconic piece of 80's drama and technology. It was also released on the legendary pirate console format known as "Zhiliton", if you are interested in that story there is a **[full article about Sewers EP](/project/sewers)**, and if you just want to listen you can **[find Sewers EP on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3OJ5DJ02jQtQ73MY64A2po)**.
