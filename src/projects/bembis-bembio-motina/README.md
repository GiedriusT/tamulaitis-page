# Bembis Bembio Motina - Ã¼ber eclectic record label

Bembis Bembio Motina Records is an uber eclectic record label that I started back in a day. It started as a joke and the literal translation of the name is Bamby Bamby's mother if you must know. I also made the funny logo with two headed Bamby blasting the sounds from his ears.

The label has eight releases under it's belt. Some are my own music, some are mixes by famous Lithuanian Dj's, we even released an illustrated musical fairytale about a toad, a cow and the meaning of life.

You can find more information about the releases, find Spotify and download links in a beautiful website of Bembis Bembio Motina built by web design agency [Code & Sprinkles](https://codeandsprinkles.com) at **[https://bembisbembiomotina.lt](https://bembisbembiomotina.lt)**.
