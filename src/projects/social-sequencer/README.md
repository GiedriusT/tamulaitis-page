# Social Sequencer

Social Sequencer is an interactive music device that allows you to create and compose music by simply arranging cubes on a sleek and intuitive board. Each cube represents a unique note or percussion sound, allowing you to build and layer intricate melodies and beats with ease. Here is a video of the device in action:

The full installation consists of three such boards representing different instruments, the idea here is to allow people to play together and create music collaboratively creating a social experience.

## The idea

The idea was born during Vilnius Light Festival 2017. We were roaming around the city and looking at all kinds of light installations. Many of them looked really impressive and beautiful, but they were mostly static and passive. That made me think how nice it would be to create something that was interactive and allow participants to be fully immersed in the experience. That's when the idea of creating the board with cubes representing musical notes struck me.

It was one of these rare cases where the original concept didn't really change much during the production process and the initial concept that I envisioned standing on a small hill in Sereikiškės park turned out to be the final product.
