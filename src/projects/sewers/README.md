# Sewers EP

Yo, dude! Let me tell you about the "Sewers EP" - the sickest music album inspired by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. This bad boy dropped back in 2011, and it was released by the super cool record label "Bembis Bembio Motina".

So get this: the "Sewers EP" only contains three tracks, but they pack a punch. They're a fusion of dubstep, hip-hop, and electronic music, all inspired by the different elements of the TMNT franchise. It's got heavy basslines, electronic beats, and fast-paced rhythms that'll make you feel like you're in the middle of a high-stakes battle in the sewers.

And get this, my dude - this EP isn't your regular old digital download. Nah, it was released on a game cartridge that's compatible with the Zhilliton computer. Talk about a throwback! The packaging is covered in colorful artwork inspired by the TMNT cartoon, and it features info about the EP's contributors.

So if you're a fan of the TMNT, dubstep, hip-hop, or electronic music, this EP is an absolute must-have. It's a funky fresh blend of old-school and new-school that's sure to have you nodding your head and pumping your fists. Cowabunga, baby!
