# Sewers EP

Sewers is my second EP, released in 2011. It revolves around the theme of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the cartoon that I was absolutely fascinated with while growing up. It was released in digital format accompanied by a limited edition of game cartidges that contained special link for downloading the extended edition of the EP.

## The cartoon

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was the first western cartoon that I ever saw on TV. I was born while Lithuania was still occupied by soviet union. There was maybe one or two state run TV stations that were broadcasting the "correct" information that was censored and handpicked by central comitee of the communist party. Therefore we as kids were only able to see a handful of soviet cartoons that were in line with the ideology.

Fortunetely, the soviet union collapsed in 1991 and Lithuania regained its independence. The first thing that changed was the TV. Suddenly there were new TV channels popping up and content on the state owned channels changed dramatically. In the very start they were just re-broadcasting some of the western TV channels without any copyright agreements, full blown pirate style. The broadcasts were not regular, so you never know what you gonna stumble upon on each channel.

I remember very vividly how one day while flipping through the channels I saw a cartoon that was unlike anything I've ever seen before. There were these green turtles, who were fighting with cool guns, riding skateboards, using high tech gadgets and eating pizza. They looked cool as hell and I was absolutely blown away. Unfortunately there was no regular schedule for the broadcasts, so I had to check the TV many times hoping that I will stumble upon this amazing cartoon again.

One more thing from the cartoon that stuck with me was the theme song. It was so catchy and energetic, filled with the sounds of guitar riffs and melody that you just can't get out of your head. I remember I had a casette recorder hooked up to TV waiting eagerly when I will stumble upon the cartoon again so I can record the theme song and listen to it on repeat for hours. Apparently that engrained into my brain so deep that good 15 years later I decided to write a whole EP dedicated to this [catchy 60 second long theme song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNa2Fr6CA0E).

## Zhiliton Entertainment System

Similar to the TV we didn't have access to any game consoles in soviet union. There was a handheld device with the game where cigarette smoking and swearing wolf from a very popular kids cartoon has to catch eggs falling from different directions. But that was pretty much it. No NES, no Sega, no nothing.

Shortly after independence first game consoles started popping up across the semi-legal markets that became popular around the contry. These were usually rip-offs of western consoles, but they were something we could afford and they were available. One of the most popular was Zhiliton, a rip-off of Nintendo Famicom designed to resemble Sega Mega Drive. I didn't own one myself as my father was very much against video games and considered them to be a complete waste of time, but I had quite a few friends who did own it and played my first video games on it.

The Zhiliton had a very distinct yellow cartidges that were used to load games. The games were ported versions of popular games so you could get good ones with games like Super Mario Bros, Contra, Battle City, etc. But they were more rare and quite expensive. The most popular ones were the ones that had 100+ games on them. Titles like "100 in 1" or "9999999 in 1" were very common. The artwork featured the screenshots from a few better games that these cartidges had, but most of the stuff inside were some glitchy, unplayable mess, many times the same game just starting from different level or with other small modifications.

## The cartidge

Since the whole EP was revolving around 8bit / 16bit sounds and themes I thought it would be nice to release it as a console cartidge, and Zhiliton cartidge made all the sense.

Of course it was already 15 years after the period when these markets and Zhiliton consoles were popular. However, I was able to find few people who are still selling them in one of the oldest and iconic markets in Vilnius called Gariūnai. Gariūnai used to be the biggest market in Lithuania and was the place where you could buy anything from food to clothes to electronics to cars. It was also the place where you could buy Zhiliton consoles and games. It was a bit of a trip down the memory lane to go there and see the place that I haven't been to since I was a kid.

To my surprise cartidges were not cheap, the price was comparable to the games you would buy for Playstation or Xbox. Luckily the seller had a whole bunch of faulty ones and we agreed that he will sell me 100 of these for a very reasonable price.

Along the cartidges I also go lots of sticly labels for these cartidges from many different games. We used them for inspiration to create the turtles related artwork for the cartidge. The illustration and design was done by very talented artist and good friend Andrius Labašauskas.
