# Skraidantis Radijas - no nonsense radio with nonsense

Skraidantis Radijas (Flying Radio in english) is a radio show we were hosting for almost 10 years. It started back in 2006 on then newly founded StartFM radio station, that promised an alternative to mainstream radio stations and focus on underground music. Here is the logo of the show made by an artist [Tomas Jefanovas](https://tomjef.com/).

It was the first live show that ever aired on StartFM, even their [Wikipedia page](https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_FM) admits that. And it was probably the most rebellious and off beat show on the station as well. Many times we were talking about absurd topics, inventing stuff as we go, consulting non-existent "experts" about subject they know nothing about, etc. But we always played nice and unique music.

There were two types of listeners of the show: "I can't stand the talks, how is it possible to talk such rubbish on live air, but I love the music" and "I love the talks, don't care about the music". The fan base was small but very dedicated. I heard stories about people listening to our show in the bathtub, because that was the only place where the reception for FM signal was good enough.

There is also a nice story of now famous Lithuanian radio host who just stumbled upon our show while driving a car and had to stop the car on the side of the road to laugh for a bit, because he found the show so hilarious that he deemed it unsafe to drive. He then found StartFM, came to talk to them and started his radio host career.
