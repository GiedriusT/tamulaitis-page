# Skraidantis Radijas - no nonsense radio with nonsense

Skraidantis Radijas (Flying Radio in english) is a radio show we were hosting for six years. It started back in 2006 on then newly founded StartFM radio station, that promised an alternative to mainstream radio stations and focus on underground music. Here is the logo of the show made by an artist [Tomas Jefanovas](https://tomjef.com/).

It was the first live show that ever aired on StartFM, even their [Wikipedia page](https://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_FM) admits that. And it was probably the most rebellious and off beat show on the station as well. Many times we were talking about absurd topics, inventing stuff as we go, consulting non-existent "experts" about subjects they know nothing about, etc. But we always played nice and rare music.

There were two types of listeners of the show: "I can't stand the talks, how is it possible to talk such rubbish on live air, but I love the music" and "I love the talks, don't care about music much". The fan base was small but very dedicated. I heard stories about people listening to our show in the bathtub, because that was the only place where the reception for FM signal was good enough.


## History

Skraidantis Radijas went through a lot of transformations during the years. The hosts changed, the concepts changed, but the dedication for playing underground music and talking nonsense always remained intact.


## First iteration

It all started in 2005 when my friend and colleague Mark Splinter came to me and said: "Hey Garo, let's do a radio show". I was hesitant at first as radio at the time was seen as this ancient thing that only plays "commercial" pop music, also I was always a bit shy about my voice as whenever I heard it played back I thought I sounded stupid. This is actually an interesting phenomena and most people experience it, but there is a very simple [scientific explanation of why our own voice sounds stupid to us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRi_ReC4lPw).

Anyway, to mitigate my worries about the lameness of the radio stations in general Mark told me that some enthusiastic students from Vilnius University got FM broadcaster license and convinced university to allocate some money for building a broadcasting studio with areas for recording and running live shows. And instead of a boring traditional student radio they aimed to build a proper radio station with a schedule of live shows from people outside university and lots of creative freedom. After some back and forth I agreed to try out to do a few shows and see how it goes.

The only thing that was missing was the name for the show. I remember sitting with Mark at Cafe De Paris, a nice cafe in the center of Vilnius, and discussing possible names and the concept for the show. I said that I don't have any ideas about the name and Mark just said: "well, we can call it Skraidantis Radijas" which in english means Flying Radio. I said "yeah, it sounds cool" and that was it, Skraidantis Radijas was born.

Equipped with the USB stick with selection of our favorite music and slightly trembling voices we came to the Start FM studio for the first time. I think "The Choice Is Yours" from the hip-hop band Black Sheep was the first track I ever played on the radio. Everybody around was pretty tense as Skraidantis Radijas was the first ever live show to be broadcasted on StartFM radio station. But all went well, we enjoyed doing that and decided to continue with the show.

However it didn't last long, and sometime in 2006 we were told that the StartFM radio station is "changing concept" and that there will be no more live shows. The main issue was that people running the station were not really in line with how they saw this station evolving, some of the key people had huge expectations of being direct competitors to mainstream radio stations in few years time, while others were way more interested in promoting underground music and various sub-cultures. It all started to crumble and went down pretty quickly. The 94.2 Mhz FM frequency was left playing one song on repeat day and night for several months. That song was "Aš nekenčiu radijo stočių" which translates to "I hate radio stations" by local punk band Turboreanimacija.


## The Golder Years

We were sad that StartFM is going down, but didn't go out of our ways to find other radio station to move to, and to be honest no other radio station would have allowed to do us what we wanted. However, after a while we heard the rumor that there is a new team forming to bring StartFM back to life.

The new director that set to reboot StartFM was Andrius Valašinas a.k.a. Kalashas, punk rock, DIY and open source enthusiast with the nickname inspired by famous soviet automatic rifle AK47, also called Automat Kalashnikov. This time the ambitions were very different. StartFM set out to be fully focused on alternative scene and became the first Lithuanian radio station to exclusively play "non-commercial" music. We couldn't be happier about this and felt strongly it's time to bring the Skraidantis Radijas back.

We were joined by Aidas Simanavičius a.k.a. Allanas, the colleague from the Fresh Rice Crew who was very keen on hosting a radio show. He also happened to know the new director of StartFM and set out to convince him to take Skraidantis Radijas in. It was not that straight forward as Kalashas was very focused on keeping fully underground vibe and wasn't convinced that the show mostly focused on hip-hop music which was gaining momentum in the mainstream at the time will be a right fit. However, all it took was for him to listen to the recording of one of our previous shows. I remember meeting him for the first time in some student party where legendary band Sportas was playing. He approached us in this loud environment and said: "Guys, I listened to the show, it's hilarious, let's do this!".

Once again we became the first live show to air on the new version of StartFM. These were the golden years of the station. They had a team of super motivated young people taking care of all the aspects of running StartFM as well as hosting all sorts of shows. You could find shows about heavy metal, feminism, trance music, politics and all sorts of other topics. Even football hooligans had their show on StartFM.

We had all sorts of team outings and seminars in old sports and recreation bases across Lithuania. That was an amazing platform to meet new people, discuss ideas with people of very different opinions and have lots of laughs. And all this was driven by idea and enthusiasm, almost nobody was getting paid.


### Hosts

There were many people who hosted the show over the years and I don't even remember who came and went when, but the show was always very vibrant and unpredictable because all of the hosts had quite a personalities. Most prominent hosts were Alanas, Tatva, Andrelis 18, Mark Splinter, Nuits and me, Garo. We were also frequently joined by Dj 2 Fresh, Dj Quazar, Matas Aerobika and Buivis, the legendary figure in Lithuanian party scene.

This was the moment when Skraidantis Radijas truly found it's identity and both the music part and the discussions were strong (althrough still loyal to nonsense). We also had many guests ranging from local artists, musicians that came to perform in Lithuania from abroad to now famous Lithuanian movie directors. The all were there and many times the show and the whole studio turned into mayhem. These definitely were the golder years of both our show and radio station as a whole.


### Music

Officially titled as the "hip-hop show" because of our personal background, the music we played actually was a much broader spectrum. We played lots of electronic music, some experimental, some heavier guitar music and all sorts of weird stuff in between.

The second installment of StartFM had one limitation on music: we couldn't play anything that is under the copyright umbrella of RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America). And that is most of the music ever released in the western world as national copyright agencies usually have contracts with RIAA protecting their copyright subjects worldwide.


## Lone Ranger period

After running strong for a few years, motivation and energy to run the show started to go down. Me and Allanas were frequently the only hosts present and one day even he told me that he doesn't want to do this anymore. I was also feeling that the show doesn't have the edge anymore, but I was still thinking about how to revitalize it by changing the concept, maybe bringing new people in and working more on social media content. Being stubborn I still decided to give it a shot even if I have to do it solo.

![Skraidantis Radijas logo](https://tamulaitis.lt/images/skraidantis-radijas/skraidantis-radijas-cover-strip-4-1.webp#full-width,animated-frames-4)

Sometimes I just played some music, other times I invited some guests, mostly musicians and Djs, and talked more about their music and some relevant stuff, although detours into the nonsense land were still frequent. I ran a show like this for a few months, but eventually had to admin to myself that the vibe is not there anymore, it's time close this chapter up and move on. The last show aired on 18-th May, 2011. After that, around 200 shows and half a month worth of content in, Skraidantis Radijas went for summer vacation and never came back. Or did he?


## Reunion 2016

Five years after the end of the show we decided to do a reunion, one long show with a lot of hosts and guests. Legendary team of Allanas, Tatva, Nuits, Andrelis 18, Tadas Quazar and 2 Fresh all assembled in the same StartFM basement. The station already had new modern studio in the center of the city, but we refused to broadcast the show from there and insisted old studio to be opened so the feel is authentic. The only other show that was still broadcasting their shows from this basement were "Audronaša", the legendary heavy metal show that started around the same time as Skraidantis Radijas and was running for almost ten years.

With this glitchy animated GIF we invited our old listeners to join us one more time and remember good old days. I don't think we made a very good show and if I remember correctly the broadcast crashed halfway and we had to break into the server room to restart the equipment, but we definitely had lots of fun and remembered tons of old stories.

## Modern Day Reboot

There is also a nice story of now famous Lithuanian radio host who just stumbled upon our show while driving a car and had to stop the car on the side of the road to laugh for a bit, because he found the show so hilarious that he deemed it unsafe to drive. He then found StartFM, came to talk to them and started his radio host career.
