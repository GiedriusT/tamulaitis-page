Introducing the ultimate music-making experience - an interactive music device that transforms the way you create and compose music. Imagine having the power to bring your musical ideas to life by simply arranging colorful cubes on a sleek and intuitive board. Each cube represents a unique note or rhythm, allowing you to build and layer intricate melodies and beats with ease.

## The idea

The idea to create an interactive music device was born from the desire to combine the fun and creativity of playing with toys with the excitement and satisfaction of making music. The creators of the device wanted to create a product that would make it easy and accessible for anyone to create and compose music, regardless of their skill level or experience.

The concept of using cubes and a board to create music was inspired by the traditional concept of a sequencer, which is a tool used to create electronic music by arranging and manipulating sound samples. The creators wanted to take this concept and make it more tactile and interactive by allowing users to physically place and arrange the cubes on the board.

They also wanted to make the device as intuitive and user-friendly as possible, so that anyone can pick it up and start creating music right away. After many months of prototyping, testing and fine-tuning the design, the interactive music device was finally brought to life, offering a new and exciting way for people to make music.
