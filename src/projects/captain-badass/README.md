# Captain Badass - game that killed the company

Captain Badass is a mobile game that started as a fun two week detour from the main title we were working on and ended up taking almost a year to release and effectively killed my gaming company OSM Games. Well, at least now there is this nice trailer.

The big idea was to use stop motion animation for all graphic elements in the game. Player planes, enemies and even bullets are actual physical objects that were photographed frame by frame and then put together into animated sequences. We probably made every possible mistake while working on this game therefore we learned enormous amount, but ultimately had to pay the hefty price.

<!-- ## The Idea, ## Visual concept, ## Soundtrack, ## Level design, ## The icon, ## Achievements, ## Development hell, ## Release disaster, ## The final flop -->
<!-- name of the game (E621, Fruits not birds), apple story, game to promote the soundtrack -->

This is v0.1 of this article. Coming soon: monosodium glutamate inspired name of the game, fighting Apple over profanity, lots of media and animated images from the game and ground shaking soundtrack that ended up being way more impressive than the game itself.
