{{PROJECT_LIST}}


## Structure and naming

We use consistent naming across projects. Folder for project should be called `project-slug`, inside there should be files:
- `index.ts` (metadata about the project)
- `media.ts` (project media imports)
- `README.md` (article about the project)
- `{project.slug}.jpg` (project thumbnail)
- `{project.slug}.mp4` (project video)
