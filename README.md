# Giedrius Tamulaitis - passionate about technology and art, and the sweet spot where the two collide

I'm Giedrius, a resident of Amsterdam originally hailing from Vilnius. Fascinated by technology and arts, and the sweet spot where the two collide. Here I share the stories about my projects.


## About me

As a musician, I have been honing my craft and making a name for myself in the industry. My unique blend of genres, including rock, pop, and electronic, creates a sound that is both fresh and familiar. I have a natural talent for writing catchy hooks and memorable melodies which has helped me to gain a dedicated fan base. I pride myself on my creative approach to music and my undeniable stage presence. I am determined to continue making waves in the industry and am excited for what the future holds.
