# Giedrius Tamulaitis

I'm Giedrius, a resident of Amsterdam originally hailing from Vilnius. Fascinated by technology and arts, exploring the sweet spot where the two collide. Here I share the stories about my projects.


## About me

My fascination with technology and arts started when my father bought me my first computer back in 1995. Since then I am on a constant journey of learning, building and experimenting. I love both technology and arts and am most fascinated to work on projects where the two go hand in hand. Currently mostly focused on a professional career as a technology leader and raising an amazing daughter, I still try to find the time to work on something creative and fun. I love to meet like minded individuals, so if you found some of my projects interesting, have something to suggest or want to collaborate, don't hesitate to drop me a line!

## Stack

This page is built with `Astro` and `React`, using `Vite` under the hood and `PNPM` as package manager. Styling is done via `SCSS` following scoped `CSS module` pattern. `Playwright` is used for running automated end-to-end tests. `ESLint` and `Husky` (with `lint-staged`) are keeping the code clean and up to the standards. `GitHub Actions` are used for simple CI/CD pipeline.

During the time project went through many transformations and rewrites, you can find [full technical decision log here](./docs/tech-decision-log.md).
